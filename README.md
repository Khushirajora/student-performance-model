📚 Student Performance Prediction
A machine learning project to predict student scores based on various academic and lifestyle factors using Linear Regression. The model helps educators and institutions identify students who may need academic support.

📌 Features
Predicts student final performance (score/grade)

Analyzes influence of features like attendance, previous grades, extracurricular activity, and study time

Achieves 98.78% accuracy using a Linear Regression model

Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature correlation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Model: Linear Regression

📊 Model Performance
Algorithm: Linear Regression

Accuracy: 98.78%

Evaluated using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📈 Output
Final prediction for student scores based on input features

Plots showing feature correlation and regression line

💡 Future Enhancements
Add classification model to predict grade categories (A/B/C)

Create a Streamlit-based web app for educators

Incorporate additional features like parental involvement or health metrics
